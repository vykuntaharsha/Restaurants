# Restaurants.com

The whole application is created using django. The website is used to post the restaurants and their menu items. A user can create his own profile, follow/unfollow other profiles. Each profile has a feed that displays on the home screen when logged in. Feed shows the menu items posted by the users that the logged in user follows. Users can register via email verification.
Implemented a string based search inside of the personal profile. Created unigue slug based urls.
